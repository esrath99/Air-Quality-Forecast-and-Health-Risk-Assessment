# Air-Quality-Forecast-and-Health-Risk-Assessment

# Objective:
This project aims to analyze air quality data to predict future AQI (Air Quality Index) values and assess associated health risks. It involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, transformation, and modeling using traditional (ARIMA) and deep learning (LSTM) methods to forecast AQI levels. Additionally, it evaluates health risk levels based on AQI predictions, providing insights into pollution severity and its potential impact on public health.
